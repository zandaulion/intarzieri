# Întârzieri

Watch one Romanian train between two stations and get a push notification when
it departs, when its delay changes, and when it arrives. Find the train by its
number, or by the stations and date of the journey.

Reached over a Cloudflare Tunnel, which terminates TLS and connects outbound
to Caddy on loopback — the host has no public IP and no inbound ports open.
Caddy serves two separate surfaces: a public one for the app, and a
tailnet-only one carrying the admin page. Behind it, a rootless podman
container runs the API.

## Where the data comes from

There is no public CFR API. The old `appiris.infofer.ro` endpoint is dead
(NXDOMAIN) and the search flow on `mersultrenurilor.infofer.ro` is ReCaptcha
gated. Two endpoints on that site are not:

| Endpoint | What it gives | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /ro-RO/Trains/LoadMapPartial` | ~1.7 MB of Leaflet markers: every running train, position, delay | live map / `/api/trains` |
| `POST /ro-RO/Trains/TrainsResult` | one train's full itinerary: ordered stations, scheduled arr/dep, per-station delay | everything else |

The POST needs an antiforgery token and a `ConfirmationKey`, both of which the
`GET /ro-RO/Train/{number}` page hands out; the `ReCaptcha` field is accepted
empty on the first attempt. So one itinerary costs two requests.

An identifying `User-Agent` is sent and works — no browser spoofing needed.

A third source serves search by stations: CFR's timetable, published as open
data. See [Searching by stations](#searching-by-stations).

### Which run

Searching a number without a date does not simply mean "today". An overnight
service that left yesterday evening is still running this morning, while
today's run of the same number has not departed yet -- defaulting to today
would offer tonight's train to someone sitting on the one in motion. So when
today's run is still in the future, the previous day's is fetched and
preferred if it is genuinely under way. The response lists both in `runs` so
the UI can offer the choice, and that second fetch only happens in the
ambiguous case; a daytime train costs one request as before.

### Branches

A train may be published as several *branches*: alternative descriptions of
the same run. IR 1996 appears as both `Constanța–Craiova` (12 stops) and
`Mangalia–Craiova` (21 stops). They are separate `div-stations-branch-*`
sections and **must** be parsed separately — concatenating them produces
duplicate stations and a timeline that jumps backwards. The one InfoFer shows
by default is the one without `d-none`.

## Searching by stations

InfoFer's own station search is the ReCaptcha-gated part, so it is not used.
The timetable behind it is published instead: each passenger operator's year
is one XML file on [data.gov.ro](https://data.gov.ro/organization/sc-informatica-feroviara-sa)
(`trenuri-2025-2026_sntfc.xml` and six siblings: Regio, Interregional,
Transferoviar, Astra, Softrans, Ferotrafic). `timetable.py` downloads them,
keeps only the stops a passenger can use, and writes `timetable.db` next to
`trips.db`. A search is then a local query: **it costs no request to CFR**,
and needs no rate limit. Only the train finally picked is looked up live, and
that goes through the ordinary itinerary path and its budget.

The index is built on first start (about ten seconds for 2,065 trains) and
data.gov.ro is asked once a day whether a file changed; an unchanged set is
not downloaded again. A new year is usually published in early December,
days before the timetable change, and the two newest files per operator are
kept so the search is right on either side of the change. A date beyond the
published year gets a message saying so rather than an empty list.

What the files say, checked against the live site:

| In the XML | Means |
|---|---|
| `ElementTrasa` | one segment; its `TipOprire` describes the station it leaves |
| `TipOprire` `C` or `A` | a stop InfoFer lists. `N` is passing through, `T` a technical halt; neither is shown |
| `OraP`, `OraS` | departure and arrival as **time of day** in seconds. They wrap at midnight, so day rollovers are counted the way `route.py` counts them |
| `CalendarTren` `Zile` | bits 0–6 are Monday to Sunday. Higher bits are set on nearly every train and are not weekdays; a calendar with no weekday bit is a train InfoFer does not publish |
| gaps between `CalendarTren` ranges | public holidays: 25 December, Easter and the like are simply left out of the ranges |

A passenger boarding after midnight on a train that left the evening before
is found through that train's own start date, which is also the run date the
itinerary lookup needs; the result carries it.

Two things do not line up and are handled:

* **Station names differ.** The file says *Ulmeni Hm.*, *Gen. Gh. Avramescu
  Hm.* and spells ş/ţ with cedillas; InfoFer says *Ulmeni*, *General Gh.
  Avramescu* and uses commas. Choosing a result selects the boarding and
  alighting stations on the live route by name with diacritics and halt
  suffixes removed, and by position in the stop list when the names still
  do not match and the two lists are the same length. The lists usually are
  the same length, but not always (IR 16535: 17 stops published, 18 live),
  so position alone is not trusted. If neither works, the route is shown for
  the user to tap as before.
* **București Nord is two stations**, `Gr.A` and `Gr.B`, its platform groups.
  They are searched as one.

Results are direct trains only. A journey with a change is two searches.

## How events are decided

InfoFer publishes no "has departed" flag, so a station counts as passed once
`scheduled_time + currently_reported_delay` is in the past — the same
arithmetic a passenger on the platform does.

- **departed** — once past the expected departure from the chosen origin.
- **delay** — when the delay at the chosen destination moves by at least
  `DELAY_THRESHOLD` (default 5 min) *since the last notification sent*, not
  since the last poll, so small drift never accumulates into spam.
- **arrived** — once past the expected arrival at the chosen destination;
  retires the trip.

A retired trip is never polled again. It stays visible in the user's list for
`LIST_KEEP_HOURS` (12) so this morning's train is still there, and is deleted
outright `PURGE_AFTER_HOURS` (48) after it finished so the table cannot grow
without bound. Only retired trips are ever purged, so an overdue train that is
still being watched is safe.

One subscription may watch `MAX_ACTIVE_TRIPS` (5) trains at once. Only
*active* trips occupy a slot -- finished ones still visible in the list, and
ones waiting to be purged, do not. The check and the insert share a
`BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction so two requests arriving together cannot both
see the last free slot; exceeding it returns 409.

Two retirement paths are distinguishable without an extra column:
`arrived = 1` means an arrival was actually detected; `active = 0` with
`arrived = 0` means the 6-hour fallback fired because the train stopped being
published. The UI shows the second as *no longer tracked* rather than
pretending it is still en route.

Subscribing to a train that already left does **not** fire a departure
notification: `trips.prime()` adopts the current state silently.

Values InfoFer marks with `*` are its own projection between staff reports
rather than a report; the UI tags these `est`.

### Reading the status line

InfoFer states the delay, the time it was reported and *where* it was measured
as one Romanian sentence, so the place only exists as prose:

| Published | Parsed |
|---|---|
| `98 min întârziere la plecarea din Târgu Ocna (Raportat la 20:59)` | +98, 20:59, Târgu Ocna, `departure` |
| `102 min întârziere la trecerea fără oprire prin Radomirești` | +102, Radomirești, `passing` |
| `166 min întârziere la sosirea în Galați` | +166, Galați, `arrival` |
| `Fără întârziere, ajuns la destinație în Ploiești Sud` | 0, Ploiești Sud, `destination` |
| `3 min mai devreme, între stațiile Brazi - Ploiești Sud` | **-3**, between Brazi/Ploiești Sud |

Note the last one: *mai devreme* means **early**, and the sign is carried by
the words rather than a minus, so it has to be applied when parsing.

### When the source goes away

CFR's whole `193.230.156.0/24` can stop answering at once — not a 404, a TCP
timeout on every host they run. Interactive lookups use a shorter timeout
than the background watcher, and a circuit breaker opens after
`BREAKER_FAILS` consecutive failures so subsequent searches fail in
milliseconds instead of each paying the timeout again. A cached route is
served in preference to an error even once expired, and `/api/health`
exposes `upstream_down` so the cause is visible rather than guessed at.

## Load on the source

Itineraries are the only thing fetched. They are requested for trains
somebody is watching, inside that train's journey window (`LEAD_MINUTES`
before scheduled departure until arrival + delay + `MAX_OVERDUE_HOURS`), and
**grouped by train** — ten people watching the same train cost one fetch, not
ten. The watcher shares the API's route cache, so a train somebody has just
looked up is not fetched again on its account. `WATCH_SECONDS` is 300: a delay that moves within five minutes is not
worth a request.

The live map endpoint was **removed**. It pulled 1.7 MB per call for data the
itinerary carries more precisely, and nothing in the app consumed it. That
also retired `iris.py` and the bundled 102 KB station list.

### Limiting what a user can cost

The watcher is bounded by construction: trips are capped per device, grouped
by train, and polled on a fixed interval. Interactive lookups are not — a
device can ask for unboundedly many distinct train numbers, and each miss is
a fetch. Two token buckets bound that:

| | burst | refill |
|---|---|---|
| per device | 8 | 20/hour |
| global | 30 | 150/hour |
| trips added, per device | 10 | 15/hour |

The budget is charged **only when a fetch actually happens** — a cache hit
costs nothing, so re-opening the same train is free. Hitting the *global*
ceiling refunds the device's token: it did nothing wrong, we ran out of our
own allowance. Exceeding a limit returns 429 with `Retry-After`.

One device exhausting its burst does not affect anyone else; verified by
running four devices through normal sessions, then one of them rogue.

### Backing off

A failed watcher pass doubles the interval — 5 min, 10, 20, 30 — capped at
`BACKOFF_MAX_SECONDS` and reset the instant a fetch succeeds. A single failed
pass keeps the normal interval, so a blip changes nothing; a day-long outage
costs 50 requests per watched train instead of 288.

A pass with nothing due neither counts against us nor clears an existing
backoff: it taught us nothing either way.

Note the circuit breaker does **not** do this job. Its cooldown (60 s) is far
shorter than the watch interval, so it has expired long before the next pass
— it exists to keep interactive searches fast, not to pace the watcher.

### Is it them or us?

`bin/probe.sh` records CFR reachability as CSV, one line per run. The value
is comparison: run it on two machines on different connections and see
whether outages coincide. If both lose it at the same moment, CFR was down.
If only one does, that network is being blocked — and the `tcp` column says
whether the block sits below HTTP, where a User-Agent cannot be the cause.

```sh
OUT=~/cfr.csv LABEL=home ./bin/probe.sh            # one check
OUT=~/cfr.csv ./bin/probe.sh summary               # what it has seen
```

## Alerts

`ops.py` publishes to [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh) on **state changes only** — one
message when the source stops answering, one when it comes back, and nothing
in between. An alert channel that repeats itself gets muted, and a muted
channel is worth nothing.

Published as JSON rather than through ntfy's header API: HTTP headers are
latin-1, so a title containing "Întârzieri" cannot be sent that way.

Set `NTFY_TOPIC` in `site.env` to enable; leave it empty and alerts are off.
On ntfy.sh the topic name *is* the credential — anyone who knows it can read
and post — so use something unguessable.

## Access control

Invite-only, no usernames or passwords. A device proves who it is with a
random token in an **HttpOnly cookie**, so the credential never touches
JavaScript. Trips belong to a device, so two phones never see each other's
trains, and one invite registers exactly one device -- "a second phone needs
a second invite" falls out of single-use invites rather than being a rule.

```
you (on the tailnet) --> ./admin.sh invite "Ana"
                             |
                             v   https://.../i/ABCD-EFGH-JKLM   (WhatsApp)
                    recipient opens --> taps "Activate this device"
                             |                    POST
                             v
                    device row + cookie --> their own trains
```

**Redemption is POST-only, behind a tap.** Chat apps fetch shared links to
build previews; if opening the URL redeemed it, WhatsApp would spend the
invite before the recipient ever saw it. Preview bots do not POST. Verified:
fetching `/i/<code>` leaves `used_at` null.

Codes are 12 characters from an alphabet with no `I`/`1`/`O`/`0` (~60 bits),
expiring after `INVITE_TTL_DAYS`. `code_hash` is the authority for redemption;
the plaintext is kept alongside it **only while the invite can still register
something**, so it can be re-shown or copied, and is wiped on redemption. A
spent invite therefore shows no code -- issue a new one rather than trying to
recover it. `./admin.sh prune` (or the button on the admin page) deletes every
used and expired invite; pending ones are never touched. They are
accepted lower-case and without dashes, because the code doubles as the way
in on iOS -- see below. Redemption is globally rate limited, since every
request arrives from Caddy on loopback and per-IP limiting would be
meaningless.

Invites and devices are managed with `./admin.sh`, or from
[pwa-invite-console](https://github.com/zandaulion/pwa-invite-console) — a graphical console fronting every app behind this
invite mechanism, which therefore lives in none of their repos.
`/api/admin/*` is explicitly 404 on the public surface, so a later change to
the public root cannot start leaking it.

The admin address is not recorded here — `./admin.sh` reads it from
`site.env`, which is gitignored. Copy `site.env.example` to get started.

Admin has **no password**: `/api/admin/*` exists only on the tailnet-only
Caddy site, which injects `X-Admin: 1`. The public site refuses those paths
outright *and* strips the header, so either control alone suffices. Manage it
with `./admin.sh`.

An unregistered device gets 401 from every endpoint except `/api/health`,
which exposes no user data and is left open for monitoring.

### Installing

The app shows an install bar when it is running in a browser rather than
standalone. On Chromium it captures `beforeinstallprompt` (suppressing
Chrome's own mini-infobar) and triggers the real install dialog; the event
fires only if the manifest, icons and a `fetch`-handling service worker are
all in order, so a missing install button means one of those broke. Safari
never fires it, so on iOS the bar explains the Share menu instead. Dismissal
is remembered in `localStorage`, and the bar hides itself once
`display-mode: standalone` matches.

### iOS

Safari and an installed PWA have **separate storage**, so a code redeemed in
Safari does not register the installed app -- and iOS only delivers push to
the installed app. Recipients should add the page to the Home Screen first,
open it from there, and type the code. That is why the invite is a typeable
code and not only a link.

## Sharing a watched trip

A trip can be shared so others follow the same train and leg without
repeating the search — one link, reusable, for the whole family.

```
owner: Distribuie  ->  https://…/s/K5PA-BWLN-5UWA
                            |
                   recipient opens  ->  "1912 din Sibiu până în Constanța"
                            |            [Urmărește]
                            v
                   their own trip, their own notifications
```

Two things this deliberately is not:

* **Not a way into the app.** The preview endpoint sits behind
  `current_device` like everything else, so an unregistered visitor gets the
  invite gate, not the train. A share link saves a registered user the
  search; it never replaces an invite.
* **Not a shared subscription.** The follower gets their own trip row, so it
  counts against their own limit, they can stop watching without affecting
  anyone, and the original is untouched. Following twice is idempotent.

Following requests push permission *before* creating the trip: the watcher
only notifies devices that have a subscription, so following without one
would appear to work and then never say anything.

## Layout

```
backend/
  db.py       sqlite connection handling
  accounts.py devices, invites, cookie tokens
  route.py    itinerary parser: branches, stops, day rollover, delays
  timetable.py published timetable: download, index, search by stations
  trips.py    SQLite store + event detection + watcher loop
  push.py     VAPID keypair + Web Push sending
  app.py      FastAPI: /api/route, /api/stations, /api/search, /api/trips, /api/vapid
web/          the PWA (no build step, no framework)
quadlet/      systemd unit for rootless podman
```

State lives in the named volume `train-api-data` (`/data`): the VAPID keypair,
`trips.db` and `timetable.db`. The last is derived and can be deleted at any
time; it is rebuilt on the next start. **The keypair must survive rebuilds** — regenerating it
silently invalidates every browser subscription already issued.

## The watching list

Each watched trip expands in place to show the train's whole route with the
chosen leg highlighted, the same rendering used when picking stations
(`stopRows()` serves both, interactive or not). Stops whose expected time has
passed are dimmed, so how far the train has got is readable at a glance.

Expanding is a local DOM toggle, not a refetch, and the panel repaints from
the cached route before revalidating -- otherwise the 60s refresh would blank
an open panel back to a loading message.

## Deploying

```sh
./deploy.sh          # web assets only
./deploy.sh --api    # also rebuild the image and restart the unit
./admin.sh invite X  # mint an invite (tailnet only)
./admin.sh invites   # list, with codes for the ones still usable
./admin.sh prune     # delete used and expired invites
./admin.sh devices   # who is registered, and what they are watching
./admin.sh revoke N  # lock a device out immediately
./admin.sh forget N  # delete a device outright (its trips go too)
./admin.sh prune-devices
```

Assets are stamped with a content hash so the service worker and the
`?v=` query strings change together.

## Caveats

- **The parsers are coupled to InfoFer's HTML** and will break when it changes.
  Mitigated, not solved: malformed blocks are skipped individually, the last
  good map snapshot keeps serving, and `/api/health` exposes `stale`,
  `consecutive_failures` and the last watch pass.
- **The timetable is the plan, not the day.** A train cancelled or diverted
  for engineering works can still appear in a station search; its live
  itinerary, fetched when it is picked, is the authority. `/api/health`
  reports when the timetable was built and the last date it covers.
- **Overnight trains** wrap past midnight; day offsets are inferred from times
  moving backwards, tracked per arrival/departure rather than per station
  (a train can arrive 23:51 and depart 00:02).
- **SQLite cannot add a foreign key with `ALTER TABLE`.** `push_subs.device_id`
  arrived that way during the migration, so on a migrated database it has no
  `ON DELETE CASCADE` and `PRAGMA foreign_key_check` reports clean because
  there is no constraint to check. Deleting a device removes its push
  subscription explicitly rather than trusting the cascade; `trips` was
  rebuilt during the migration so it does carry the key. The same limitation
  is why `ON CONFLICT(device_id)` needs its unique index created by hand.
- **An invite link is a bearer token.** Whoever opens it first is registered.
  Forwarded in a group chat, it is gone -- single use, expiry and revocation
  limit the damage but do not prevent it. `./admin.sh devices` shows
  last-seen times so a stranger is visible.
- **Losing the cookie means losing access.** Cleared site data, a different
  browser, or private browsing all need a fresh invite. Storage for a
  *non-installed* site on iOS is evicted after 7 days idle, which is another
  reason to install to the Home Screen.
- The public hostname is reachable by anyone; the gate is application-level,
  so an unregistered visitor can load the shell but can do nothing with it.
- **iOS** only exposes Web Push to PWAs installed to the Home Screen.
- Delays are reported by station staff, so they are as accurate — and as
  granular — as those reports.
